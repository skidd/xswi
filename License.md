The latest version of this project is available under the MIT License.

MIT license allows you to distribute properitary (also commercial) software without opening up your code to anyone ([link1](http://www.tophatstuff.co.uk/?p=40), [link2](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/706799/mit-license), [google](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=mit+license+faq)).

# Author's intentions #
My intention is to make people freely use the code, link, distribute, sell, whatever they want. And hopefully report bugs, if any.

This piece of code is quite 'final' as a piece of work, i.e. there are not very many things you can do to extend or further develop it; it is a simple tool and should stay that way.

I am happy as long as no-one passes the source code on as only their own work, so if you feel the license somehow does not cover your needs, drop me a line.

# History #
Previous versions, with equivalent functionality, are available under LPGL or the GNU All-Permissive License, however some users have commented that LPGL is unpractical. On the other hand, the GNU All-Permissive License is not very explicit and aslo it seems not very well known amoung the target users.
